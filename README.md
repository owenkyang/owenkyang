I'm a third-year Data Science and Math-CS student at UC San Diego 🔱. I'm a huge API and ML enthusiast and love learning new technologies. I'm passionate about making the tech industry less daunting and more widespread!

 I'm currently working at:
  <!-- - Nowhere! Would love to work on new projects :) -->
  - ⚛️ [AIRE Labs](https://aobol.github.io/AoboLi/) as a Machine Learning Researcher, building a framework to streamline quantization and hyperparameter searching through Bayesian optimization. (HDSI Research Scholarship Project)
  - 🔬 [LASR Labs](https://quote.ucsd.edu/lasr/lab-members/) as an Undergraduate Research Assistant, researching how STT LLMs interact with child and accented speech!
  - 🧑🏻‍🏫 [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) @ UCSD](https://acmucsd.com/) as a Professional Events Director, teaching how to approach Leetcode and other tech interview subjects!


 I previously was at:
  - 🖥️ [AT&T](https://about.att.com/sites/labs), as a Technology Intern where I worked on Multimodality Models and Backend Development.
  - 🖥️ [Targify.io](https://www.linkedin.com/company/targify-io/about/), as a Software Engineering Intern where I worked on Full Stack development.

Some Projects I am working on:
  - SchedulEase:
    - Do you hate manually inputting your timetable into your calendar?
    - Is it painfully tedious to switch back and forth between your class syllabus and calendar to input every due date?
    - Is being organized something you struggle with?
   
    Take a screenshot of any schedule: classes, syllabus, and use SchedulEase to automatically input it in your Google calendar!
Hackathon Wins:
- [Big Data Hackathon](https://bigdataforsandiego.github.io/) won $1000 for Most Innovative Project! Check it out here:
