I'm a third-year Data Science student at UC San Diego 🔱. I'm a huge API and ML enthusiast and love learning new technologies. I'm passionate about making the tech industry less daunting and more widespread!

 I'm currently working at:
  <!-- - Nowhere! Would love to work on new projects :) -->
  - ⚛️ [AIRE Labs](https://aobol.github.io/AoboLi/) as a Developer, quantizing a PointNet model to be deployed on FPGA chips.
  - 🔬 [LASR Labs](https://quote.ucsd.edu/lasr/lab-members/) as an Undergraduate Research Assistant, researching how STT LLMs interact with child and accented speech!
  - 🧑🏻‍🏫 [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) @ UCSD](https://acmucsd.com/) as a Professional Events Director, teaching how to approach Leetcode and other tech interview subjects!


 I previously was at:
  - 🖥️ [AT&T Labs](https://about.att.com/sites/labs), as a Software Engineering Intern where I worked on Multimodality Models and AR.


Some Projects I am working on:
  - Automatic Remote Meeting Attendance Taker that uses Computer Vision to automatically mark attendance for your remote classes and meetings!

Current Learning Goals:
  - Learn more about Cloud Computing and Networking
  - Have a greater understanding of Databases and API development
